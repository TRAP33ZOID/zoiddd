### What languages are supported?
Currently, Zoid supports English (en-US) and Modern Standard Arabic (ar-SA). Additional dialects and languages will be added in future releases.

### How accurate is the AI response?
The accuracy depends on the quality and relevance of your knowledge base documents. The system uses vector similarity search to find the most relevant context before generating responses.
