# AI Support Agent Project Progress

## Goal
To build a dedicated, Retell AI-like application for general customer service, starting with basic Q&A using a user-uploaded knowledge base (Retrieval-Augmented Generation - RAG). The long-term goal includes advanced features like troubleshooting, tool use/function calling, and human handoff.

## Current Status
We are currently in the initial setup phase, focusing on establishing the core RAG chat functionality.

## Implementation Plan (TODO)

[x] Define the scope and core features of the AI support agent.
[x] Create a progress document (`PROGRESS.md`) to track implementation.
[x] Select the AI model and necessary APIs (e.g., Gemini API).
[x] Set up the environment for RAG (install dependencies).
[x] Implement a basic RAG flow (data ingestion and retrieval simulation).
[x] Set up the backend API route for handling basic chat interactions.
[-] Design and implement a minimal frontend chat interface.
[ ] Integrate the frontend with the backend API.
[ ] Test and refine the agent's performance.
