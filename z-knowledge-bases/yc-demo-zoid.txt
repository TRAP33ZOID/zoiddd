# Zoid AI Voice Agent - Company Knowledge Base

## About Zoid

Zoid is an AI-powered voice agent platform that helps businesses provide 24/7 customer support through phone calls. We combine real-time speech recognition, advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and natural language AI to create voice agents that actually understand context and answer accurately.

**Founded:** 2024
**Focus:** MENA region (Middle East & North Africa)
**Languages:** English and Modern Standard Arabic
**Tech Stack:** Built on Gemini 2.5 Flash, VAPI.ai telephony, Supabase vector database

## The Problem We Solve

Businesses in the MENA region struggle with:
- Expensive call centers operating 24/7
- Language barriers (English + Arabic support required)
- Inconsistent customer service quality
- Slow response times and high wait times
- Difficulty scaling support during peak hours

Traditional chatbots can't handle voice calls. IVR systems are rigid and frustrating. Hiring bilingual support teams is costly. We solve all three.

## Our Solution

Zoid is a complete voice AI platform that:
1. **Answers phone calls** in real-time with natural conversation
2. **Retrieves information** from your knowledge base using RAG
3. **Speaks naturally** in English or Arabic
4. **Scales instantly** - handles 1 call or 1000 calls
5. **Tracks everything** - full call logs, transcripts, and analytics

### Technical Capabilities
- **Response Time:** <200ms latency (feels like talking to a human)
- **Accuracy:** Context-aware responses using vector search
- **Bilingual:** Full support for English and Modern Standard Arabic
- **Reliable:** 99%+ uptime, automatic failover
- **Integrated:** Webhook-based, easy to plug into existing systems

## How It Works

1. **Customer calls** your phone number
2. **Zoid answers** and asks how it can help
3. **AI listens** and transcribes speech to text in real-time
4. **RAG retrieves** relevant information from your knowledge base
5. **AI generates** a natural, context-aware response
6. **Voice synthesis** converts response to speech
7. **Customer hears** the answer in <500ms

Everything happens in real-time. No awkward pauses. No robotic responses.

## Why MENA Focus?

The MENA region has unique challenges:
- Bilingual requirements (English + Arabic)
- High smartphone adoption but low chatbot trust
- Growing e-commerce but limited support infrastructure
- Cultural preference for voice over text

We're building specifically for these needs with:
- Native Arabic language support (not just translation)
- Regional voice options
- Cultural context awareness
- Local deployment options (data residency)

## Roadmap

**Current (Phase 5.5):** Call logs dashboard with analytics
**Next (Phase 6):** User profiles and conversation history
**Future:**
- Additional Arabic dialects (Egyptian, Gulf, Levantine)
- Tool use / function calling (CRM integration, booking systems)
- Human handoff for complex queries
- Multi-channel support (web, WhatsApp, SMS)
